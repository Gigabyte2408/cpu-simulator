# cpu-simulator
A python based cpu simulator that uses mips architecture to emulate cache, GPR, memory, and MIPS Instructions
Instructions meant to be handled by this project include operands such as: ADD, ADDI, SUB, SUBI, J, JR, HALT, LW, SW, and more.
Created a main function that incorporates functionality of all classes to simulate the loading and performing of instructions.

# Yet to do
Take a list of instructions, store them in memory, store arbitrary values in GPR, test program on various sets of instructions.
